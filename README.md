# Cloud-Native Streaming Platform (Architecture Blueprint)

This repository presents a **production-grade, cloud-native streaming platform** cloud architecture & solutions, engineered on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  

It exemplifies **enterprise-level system design** blending **serverless scalability**, **stateful compute**, **event-driven data pipelines**, and **machine intelligence** — all orchestrated for **high availability**, **global reach**, and **observability at scale**.

## 🚀 Executive Overview

The architecture emulates a **modern Video-on-Demand (VOD)** ecosystem, built for **elastic growth, operational resilience, and low-latency media delivery**.  

It demonstrates how a cloud-native enterprise might structure services to achieve:
- **Zero-downtime scalability** — elastic scaling under unpredictable load.
- **Low-latency global distribution** — media served from the nearest edge.
- **Separation of concerns** — stateless microservices + stateful persistence.
- **Observability by design** — end-to-end tracing, metrics, and alerts.
- **ML-powered intelligence** — continuous personalization and analytics.

## 🧩 Architectural Philosophy

> “Design systems to **scale linearly**, fail **gracefully**, and recover **autonomously**.”

The architecture follows **polyglot persistence** and **hybrid compute** principles — combining serverless services for stateless workloads and dedicated compute clusters for data-heavy streaming and ML inference.  

It’s composed of **seven cooperating layers**, each optimized for cost, performance, and isolation.

| Layer | Primary GCP Services | Objective |
|--------|-----------------------|------------|
| **Client & Edge** | Cloud CDN, HTTPS Load Balancer, Cloud Armor | Global edge delivery & security |
| **Application APIs** | Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, API Gateway | Stateless, scalable microservices |
| **Media Processing** | Transcoder API, GKE, Cloud Storage | Video ingest, encoding, and packaging |
| **Data Layer** | Firestore, Cloud SQL, Spanner | User data, metadata, transactions |
| **Analytics & Events** | Pub/Sub, Dataflow, BigQuery | Real-time analytics pipeline |
| **Machine Learning** | Vertex AI, BigQuery ML | Personalization & recommendations |
| **Operations & Security** | IAM, Secret Manager, Cloud Monitoring | Governance, visibility, and compliance |
